# Description
This is my second project in the course. I completed it in week 6. I chose to build an App which gives suggestions for ways to relax. 

### Deployment Link 
https://relax-now.netlify.app/

### Code Installation
https://github.com/Claire-bot87/my-relaxation-api)


### Timeframe and Working Team

I worked independently for this project. We had 1 week to complete it.

### Technologies Used
- Node
- Express
- EJS
- Mongoose
- MongoDB Compass
- Netlify


### Brief
- Build an application with full CRUD functionality.
- The app must utilise EJS templates for rendering views to users.
- The app must use session-based authentication.
- The appâ€™s files must be organised according to convention.
- The app must have at least one data entity in addition to the User model.
- At least one entity must have a relationshuip with the user model.
- Authorisation must be implemented (only logged in users can create, update or delete data).
- The app must be deployed online.

## Build Process



#### File structure
First I built out the models:
- User Model
- Suggestion Model

In my suggestion model I had a 'category' key, because I wanted to group the suggestions by category.
Then I built my controllers and my views.

#### A detailed look at adding a new suggestion

##### First, I rendered the new suggestion page:
Controller:
```.js
router.route('/suggestion/new').get(async function (req, res, next) {
  try {
    res.render('suggestion/new.ejs')
  } catch (e) {
    next(e)
  }
})
```
View:
```.js
<%- include('../partials/html-head') %>
<%- include('../partials/nav') %>

<h1>add a new suggestion</h1>

<form action= "/suggestion/new" method="POST">
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" name="name" id="name">  
    <label for="description">Description:</label>
    <input type="text" name="description" id="description"> 
    <label for="category">Category:</label>
    <input type="text" name="category" id="category"> 
    <button type="submit">Add suggestion</button>
      </form>
</body>
</html>

```

##### Then, I enabled a POST request to post a new suggestion, adding it to the database:
```.js
router.route('/suggestion/new').post(async function (req, res) {
 
  try {

    if (!req.session.user) {
      return res.status(402).send({ message: "you must be logged in to save a suggestion" })
    }

    req.body.user = req.session.user
  
    // Get the new destination from the body of request
    const newSuggestion = await Suggestion.create(req.body)
    // Send back our destination with appropriate status code.
    res.redirect('/')
  } catch (e) {
    next(e)
  }
})
```


## Challenges
I learnt many new concepts in this module, for example:
- The request response cycle.
- Testing requests and responses using Postman.
- Creating a database and making a request to the database.
- Using conditional statements to decide which elements to render in EJS. This was a good foundation for my later learnings about conditional rendering in ReactJS.
- Session-based authentication. This was a good starting point, from which I could later learn token-based authentication.

## Wins

I needed to render an index of suggestions for 1 particular category. We had not done this in class before, so it was a challenge. I used links in my home page, linking to an index for each category. Those links provided the route/path I needed. I used req.params.category to capture each specific category and render just the suggestions for that category. I did this by passing chosenCategory as a 'local'.
```.js
router.route('/suggestion/:category').get(async function (req, res) {
  const user = req.session.user
  
  const suggestions = await Suggestion.find()
  const chosenCategory = req.params.category
  res.render('index.ejs',
    {
      suggestions: suggestions,
      chosenCategory: chosenCategory,
      user: user,
    }
  )
})
```

I then rendered the suggestions for just that chosen category in my view:
```.js
<h1><%= chosenCategory %></h1>
<div class="index-grid">
<% suggestions.filter(suggestion => suggestion.category.toLowerCase() === chosenCategory.toLowerCase()).forEach(suggestion => { %>
  
      <div class="suggestion-card"><ul>

        
          <li class="suggestion-name"><%= suggestion.name %></li>
          <li class="suggestion-description"><%= suggestion.description %></li>
```

## Key Learnings
Understanding how req.params works.


## Bugs
I have a CSS issue, when the suggestion boxes populate a second row, they overlap witht he 'add a new suggestion' link.

## Future Improvements
- I want to add in a feature where you can add a review on the suggestion. 
- I would also like to add a star-rating feature on the suggestion. Then I would create a filter so that you can view the top-rated suggestions.
