## Build Process



File structure
First I built out the models:
- User Model
- Suggestion model

In my suggestion model i had a category key, because I wanted to group the suggestions by category.
Then I built my controllers and my views.

A detailed look at adding a new suggestion. 

First I rendered the new suggestion page:
Controller
```.js
router.route('/suggestion/new').get(async function (req, res, next) {
  try {
    res.render('suggestion/new.ejs')
  } catch (e) {
    next(e)
  }
})
```
view:
```.js
<%- include('../partials/html-head') %>
<%- include('../partials/nav') %>

<h1>add a new suggestion</h1>

<form action= "/suggestion/new" method="POST">
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" name="name" id="name">  
    <label for="description">Description:</label>
    <input type="text" name="description" id="description"> 
    <label for="category">Category:</label>
    <input type="text" name="category" id="category"> 
    <button type="submit">Add suggestion</button>
      </form>
</body>
</html>

```



Then I enabled a POST request to post a new suggestion, adding it to the database.
```.js
router.route('/suggestion/new').post(async function (req, res) {
 
  try {

    if (!req.session.user) {
      return res.status(402).send({ message: "you must be logged in to save a suggestion" })
    }

    req.body.user = req.session.user
  
    // Get the new destination from the body of request
    const newSuggestion = await Suggestion.create(req.body)
    // Send back our destination with appropriate status code.
    res.redirect('/')
  } catch (e) {
    next(e)
  }
})
```
